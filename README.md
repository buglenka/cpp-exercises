# cpp-exercises

Here is the repo with my solution of problems from www.interviewbit.com. 

I have made simple CMake/CPP project using Google Test Framework for developing and testing of my ideas. 

How to use my code:

Google Test Framework will be downloaded from GitHub and built with the project.

$ clone this repo
$ cd cpp-exercises
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .
$ ctest -VV
